AI-Based Crop Recommendation System 🌾
📌 Project Description
This project is a machine learning based crop recommendation system that suggests the most suitable crop based on soil nutrients and environmental conditions.

The model uses parameters such as:

Nitrogen (N)
Phosphorus (P)
Potassium (K)
Temperature
Humidity
pH
Rainfall
🎯 Objective
To help farmers or users choose the best crop to grow by predicting the most suitable crop using machine learning.
